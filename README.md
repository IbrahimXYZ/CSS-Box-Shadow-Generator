# CSS-Box-Shadow-Generator

## This a Box shadow generator for CSS

This project is a box shadow generator that provides the user with inputs, where the user can manipulate the inputs as well as see how the input effects the div or box. Once the user has used the inputs to their liking, the user can copy the code to their clipboard.

Skills used:
-HTML 
-CSS
-JavaScript
-SCSS

I built this project since i would forget or sturggle with what values to input or waht values mainpulate what design elements in the box shadow element. Not only i now have a better understanding but a too that quickly and accurately give me the box shadow css design i want.

What I learnt:
I practiced my knowledge on inputs and using their values.

What I Enjoyed:
I enjoyed coding the inputs and them being able to manipulate live, the div or item i would want to look like.

What I would Improve:
In terms of what i would like to improve, i think being able to rewrite it in ReactJS or any other JavaScript framework. In addition, maybe improving the user interface to look more aesthetcially pleasing.
